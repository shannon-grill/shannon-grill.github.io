               <p>Hey Shannon, might be wondering why go to a website if I could have just send it on whatsapp or u might not even wonder lol.But you should know by now i do things differently. Well by coing to this website this means anybody can really read what your about to read and thats ok with me. Let the world know how much I love you I really dont care.</p>
               <p>Remember when I told you I will one day tell you how I really feel about you well this is that day. U might read this today or tomorrow or some other time. But this is the right time now to tell you.</p>
               <p>Well my feelings for you is way to much to control and my love for you is unconditionally a lot. I love you so much that just getting your smell as soon as you leave when you are by me just makes me start crying. No jokes, im being so serious I cont be more serious about my feelings for you. I would literally do anything for you. You mean so much to me and I really dont know what i would without you. I feel so lonely if I dont see like my heart starts breaking even the days we dont talk is tought for me my heart literally breaks if I see your name. My stubborness just takes control and says dont message you but inside im dying I really wanna message you but I dont know if its a good idea or a bad idea.</p>
               <p>Baby your my life, you are my ride or die. I cant see my life without you. I want to be with you everyday i just wanna hold you and never let go like it scares me if i just let go of you. The day we first started chatting I never thought you would mean so much to me. Yes, we may not have talked for the first 3 months but after that I started feeling comfortable talking to you. I started get feelings for you that i never felt for anybody else accept you. I always thought I already lost my true love, but i was wrong you are my True Love and also my First Love. I want it to stay like that I really never want to lose you. I might be a asshole most of the times and im sorry but i get scared then i start fucking everything up. If i start feeling like im about to loose you I start fucking things up and im so sorry that i do that i dont know why i do that.</p>
               <p>Never forget that I love you and would never leave you or never hurt you. I woulnt even dare to cheat because one does not cheat if they are truly inlove and also doesnt hurt or lie or be unfaithful to there partner. Your my partner your my ride or die Shannon. Sometimes it feels like you dont know that and i need to remind you of that again. I will remind you over and over till the day I day. Your my light in the darkness. Women you are the best thing that ever happened to me and I couldnt ask for anyone better than you Shannon. I might not be the best Boyfriend or Friend sometimes but im trying so hard to be just believe me when i say I love you and would do anything for you Shannon. 11/04/2018 the day we started dating, the day i changed. Believe it or not i literally cant live without you I need to talk to you almost everyday and if i dont then im dying inside. Im so used to talking to you everyday that its a habit but also because your part of my life but also because you are my life and i need you. Your like my life support if i can say so. I LOVE YOU SHANNON GRILL</p>
